[00:00.47] My chest is hurting
[00:03.08] My feet can't fall out of bed
[00:05.87] I don't know where to go so I'll lay here instead
[00:10.75] With my symptoms, symptoms of sorrow and dread
[00:15.36] They all said it would fade, but again and again
[00:20.71] I love
[00:23.07] I love
[00:25.43] I love, I love, I love
[00:30.28] I love
[00:32.71] I love
[00:35.03] I love
[00:41.50] I've been so busy
[00:44.94] But now that I'm alone, where did you go
[00:49.06] Tell me why
[00:52.23] Why can't you live at home tonight and stay with me inside
[00:59.14] It's nice
[01:03.06] Please I wanna see what we would be if you were by my side
[01:08.02] Make me feel lonely soon
[01:10.34] You might not know me, I wish I could lie
[01:15.21] But I can't deny
[01:17.50] My chest is hurting
[01:19.85] My feet can't fall out of bed
[01:22.53] I don't know where to go so I'll lay here instead
[01:27.46] With my symptoms, symptoms of sorrow and dread
[01:31.96] They all said it would fade but again and again
[01:37.48] I love
[01:39.92] I love
[01:42.28] I love, I love, I love
[01:47.13] I love
[01:49.48] I love
[01:51.85] I love
[01:54.85] 
[02:16.93] I'm hurting, I'm stuck in my bed
[02:20.25] I don't know where to go so I'll lay here instead
[02:25.09] With my symptoms, symptoms of sorrow and dread
[02:29.69] They all said it would fade, but again and again
[02:35.10] I love
[02:37.53] I love
[02:39.90] I love, I love, I love
[02:44.73] I love
[02:47.09] I love
[02:49.53] I love, I love, uh huh
